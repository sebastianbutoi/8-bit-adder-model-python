# 8-bit-adder-model-python

The 8-bit binary adder is a circuit producing arithmetical sum of two 8-bit binary. It can be obtained by consecutive connections of the full adder so that each output of carry from each full adder is closed in a chain towards the input of carry of the next full adder.
A python program has been developed to implement the model and to process the data. The application allows both binary and decimal format input data. Furthemore, there is an extension which calcualtes the subtraction of the two input values by using the 1st and 2nd complement.
